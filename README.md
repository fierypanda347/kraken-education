## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Kraken 
Kraken Education is a startup founded by Advait Variyar and Dylan D'Souza in order to help teachers organise all their classroom resources in one helpful desktop app.

Kraken helps teachers out with reports on how the class is doing with useful graphs and charts. It allows teachers to enter assessment marks and see how a student has progressed, how the student is doing compared to the class, and many more such visualisations. Kraken also has a few side features such as a database for teachers to enter their students' marks and a few tools that help out with class planning such as dividing the class into groups, sorting students in an alphabetical or roll number wise order.

## üõ† How to Start Developing Kraken

#### NOTE:
Before you start developing on Kraken Education, ensure that you have sufficient knowledge about React, Electron and popular frameworks in the React and Electron Ecosystems. We would love to have you on board! üöÇ

#### 1. Fork the Kraken Education repository to your GitHub account
The first step to get started with contributing is to fork the project to your own account. This creates a seperate version of the project that you can work on. After you're done with your changes you can issue a pull request to merge the branch to the main project.

To create a fork, go to the [Project GitHub Page](https://github.com/fierypanda347/kraken-education) and click the Fork button on the top-right corner of the screen.

#### 2. Clone the kraken repository to your device using the GitHub Desktop App
Download the app from https://desktop.github.com/ and login using your GitHub account.
In the app, clone the repository by using the keybind Command+Shift+O (for MacOS) or Ctrl+Shift+O (for Windows) and selecting the Kraken Project from the pop-up menu.

You can now open the repository in the text editor of your choice by using the keybind Command+Shift+A (for MacOS) or Ctrl+Shift+A (for Windows).

#### 3. Install Node.js, NPM and Dependencies to your device
To check if you have node.js installed on your device, open your command line tool of preference and type 'node -v'. Ensure that you have the latest LTS version of Node installed on your device to avoid any unecessary errors during development. If you do not have node.js installed, click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install the latest LTS version.
NPM is the Node Package Manager that will allow us to install Dependencies. NPM is installed along with node.js.

Once you have Node.js and NPM installed, open your command line of choice and locate to the project folder. Install all dependencies by running 'npm install' or simply just 'npm i'. Now you have all the tools necessary to start development.

#### 4. Read over the project
Kraken is already a project in development. Before you start contributing, make sure you read the code. Throughout development, we have tried to add helpful comments to make the code easier to read. If you have any doubts feel free to contact Advait Variyar or Dylan D'Souza.

#### 5. When committing files, NEVER commit node_modules files
These files are the dependencies that are added to the project. They are huge files and cannot be added to the GitHub repository. Whenever committing files, always make sure you are only committing only code files that you have recently changed and nothing else.

#### 6. NEVER COMMIT CODE TO THE MAIN BRANCH
The Main Branch of this repository is the current final version of the app. If you do make changes to the code, please commit them to a seperate branch and issue a pull request. Once you do this, either Advait Variyar or Dylan D'Souza will go over the changes suggested and add them to the Main Branch accordingly.

#### NOTE: Please write meaningful comments during development and fill in a genuine title and description of the commit being made to the repository.

### Thank You for helping us make Kraken a great application for everyone!
